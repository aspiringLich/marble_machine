# marble_machine

a lil game idea i had that won't go away.

Essentially: it's a game that draws *heavy* inspiration from the game [Turing Complete](https://turingcomplete.game/). A puzzle game where the end goal is to create a computer essentially, except instead of wires like a normal person you shoot around marbles. Also it'll be way worse (if i even finish it that is).

So like yeah.
